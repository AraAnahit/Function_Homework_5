# H1 **Functions**
1. Could solve only 2 task (Split Even Odd Numbers) and (Calculate elements inside array)

[Split Array numbers into 2 arrays "odd' and "even"](https://github.com/AraAnahit/Function_Homework_5/blob/Functions_Homework/Split_Numbers.js)

Didn't make to solve other tasks due to lack of knowledge of arrays and its methods.
